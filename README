This is a script to cross load subversion repositories (kind of) keeping history
intact without access to svnadmin.  Import into a FRESH repository only, and
be sure to do a comprehensive diff at the end.

Also be sure to do this in an empty directory. Temp files get added and removed
without sincere thought put into them.

Log messages get eaten and re-inserted as shown below. Edit to taste.
  $ svn log -r 1
